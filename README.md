This project encompasses a comprehensive data analysis pipeline, comprising web scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data wrangling, and data visualization. The goal is to extract, explore, clean, and visualize data to derive actionable insights.

Web Scraping

Overview

Web scraping involves extracting data from websites, enabling access to valuable information not readily available through traditional means.

Tools Used

	•	Python libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium for fetching and parsing HTML data.

Key Steps

	1.	Identifying Data: Understanding website structure and pinpointing relevant data.
	2.	Fetching Data: Retrieving HTML content from web pages.
	3.	Parsing Data: Extracting desired information from HTML using parsing techniques.
	4.	Handling Dynamic Content: Using Selenium for scraping dynamic content.
	5.	Storing Data: Saving scraped data in appropriate formats for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview

EDA involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify insights.

Objectives

	•	Understand data distributions, relationships, and trends.
	•	Identify outliers, missing values, and anomalies.

Key Techniques

	•	Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
	•	Data Visualization: Creating visual representations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
	•	Grouping and Aggregation: Analyzing data by categories or groups.
	•	Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing missing data points.
	•	Exploring Data Relationships: Examining correlations between variables.

Data Wrangling

Overview

Data wrangling involves preprocessing raw data to make it suitable for analysis.

Steps Involved

	1.	Data Acquisition: Obtaining data from various sources like files or databases.
	2.	Data Cleaning: Addressing issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
	3.	Data Transformation: Converting data into a usable format, handling categorical variables, and feature engineering.
	4.	Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources, if applicable.

Data Visualization

Overview

Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to convey insights effectively.

Objectives

	•	Present insights and patterns visually.
	•	Communicate complex information clearly.
	•	Identify relationships and trends within the data.

Techniques Used

	•	Plotting: Generating various types of charts and graphs such as bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots.
	•	Customization: Tailoring visualizations for clarity and emphasis.
	•	Interactivity: Creating interactive visualizations for deeper exploration.
	•	Tool Utilization: Leveraging libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for visualization.
